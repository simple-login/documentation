## Delete an alias

We recommend **against** deleting an alias and suggest either disable the alias or [block some of its senders](block-sender.md).

If you really want to delete an alias, you can click on "More" button, then "Delete" button.

When an alias is deleted, depending on your setting, it's either:

- immediately put into a global trash and we make sure that it can't be reused. All historic information on the alias (the account that creates the alias, alias contacts, etc) are deleted to respect your privacy.

- moved to the global trash after 30 days. In the meantime, you can restore it. This is the default option.

The above applies to all aliases created with SimpleLogin domains.

For aliases created with your own domain or provided SimpleLogin subdomains, you can always **recreate** them. Please note that this isn't the same as **restoring** an alias as all records like contacts, settings, etc associated with an alias are deleted when the alias is deleted.

## Recreate a deleted alias

If an alias **belongs to your domain or subdomain**, it's moved to the domain "Trash" when it's deleted. In order to be able to recreate the alias, you first need to move it out of the trash.

First click on "Details" on the [domain](https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/) page or [subdomain]( https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/subdomain) page.

Then click on "Deleted Alias" on the right sidebar:

Here you can either remove a specific alias from the trash or empty the trash.

Once removed from the trash, you can recreate the alias, either on the [custom alias page](https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/custom_alias) or by using the catch-all option.
