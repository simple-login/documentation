### **How to know if a website is blocking SimpleLogin?**

You will notice this when website is blocking you to register with your unique SimpleLogin alias. Some websites are transparent and display an error message like *“This email address is not accepted”*.

Other websites are sending more generic error messages or not even display any error. In that case, try registering with another email address (proton.me or gmail.com).
