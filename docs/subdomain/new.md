Having a subdomain allows you to quickly create aliases on the flight, i.e. you don't have to open SimpleLogin app to create a new alias.

For example, if you own the subdomain `my-sub.aleeas.com`, you can make up an alias like mcdonald@my-sub.aleeas.com when you are commanding a McDonald burger without opening SimpleLogin app.

To add a new subdomain, head to the Dashboard and notice the new Subdomains button on the menu:

You can then create a new subdomain, `my-sub` in this case:

![](./new.png)

Once created, you can either create a new alias with this new subdomain

or just start make up aliases like `anything`@my-sub.aleeas.com. `anything` can be replaced by, well, anything :).

If you want to have more control over the subdomain, you can also use the "Auto Create". Although this uses regular expressions, you don't need to be a regular expression guru to use it.

The subdomain feature is currently only available in the Premium plan.
