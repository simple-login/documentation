## Recovery codes

After setting up 2FA, you will see recovery codes. Store recovery codes in a safe and easily accessible location, considering using a secure physical drive (recommended) or password manager. Be aware that each recovery code is single-use and can't be used several times. 
We recommend to keep track of used and unused codes to maintain account accessibility.
